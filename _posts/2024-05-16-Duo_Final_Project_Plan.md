Project Plan: Algorithmic Loops for K-Pop Album Data
- Define the project scope and goals specific to K-Pop album data.
    - Create an application that processes and analyzes K-Pop album data using algorithmic loops.
- Analyze sample K-Pop album data structures.
    - Data parsing and validation.
    - Sorting albums by different criteria (e.g., release year, genre, decibels).
    - User ratings to signify how decision of song choice was.
    - Counting tracks and analyzing genres.
    - Generating reports
- Design the specific algorithms for processing K-Pop album data.
    - Use dictionaries, lists, and hashmaps to store album information.
    - Define classes
    - Loop through albums to perform operations
    - Filtering by categories
- Implement the designed system and algorithms.
    - Read and validate JSON data.
    - Convert JSON data into java script objects.
    - Loop through album data for extract criterias set.
- Sort and filter albums based on user criteria.
- Implement UI / styling
- Deploy

We are going to make a loops (algorithmic) program with the interaction of soothing K-pop music. We will be using a dataset of hashmaps that will loop until a certain specification, whether it's decibels, length, genre, etc., is defined in an input. The music will then play instantly after being chosen, or it can be switched to another song if the sound isn't in the right mood. The computer can't determine this, and it will be up to the user to decide what is right.
