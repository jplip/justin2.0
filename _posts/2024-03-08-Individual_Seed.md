| Justin Liporada | [Profile](https://github.com/jplip) | Definefilety thought I could do more with last tri and think that I can do even better with the knowledge I already know. I think I was a little idle throughout the last project and just went with the flow but definetely striving for more speed and efficient working. | [CPT Individual](https://jplip.github.io/justin2.0//2024/02/26/CPT-Individual.html), [N@TM](https://jplip.github.io/justin2.0//2024/02/16/N@TM.html), [College Board](https://jplip.github.io/justin2.0//2023/12/22/College_Board_Reflection.html) | [Debug issue](https://github.com/jplip/justin2.0/issues/6) login system, token and jwt, [test with math](https://github.com/jplip/frontTri2/blob/main/BD_stress.md), [user data table](https://github.com/jplip/frontTri2/blob/main/BE_update.md)
