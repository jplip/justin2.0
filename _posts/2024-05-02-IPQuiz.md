- I got this wrong because I thought the protocols helped keep transferred data secure. That is not the case, as they are not designed to be completely secure. The correct answer is C because the protocols make it so that there is a standard format for messages to be sent to devices on the internet.

**Question 28:** <!-- Section 5.6 -->

- I got this wrong because I thought this type of attack was already on the server domain, but within the context, it looks like the unauthorized individual was posing as an admin instead of already being one. The correct answer is A because they are connecting to a weakly secured router that allows the unauthorized individual the ability to view the network traffic.

# Reflection
I did pretty well with the test and got stumped a few times. I think that I definitely did not fully know some answers for sure and went with the best answer I could choose in some parts of the test. I can definitely read more on the subjects to be able to answer the questions way faster than I did today.
