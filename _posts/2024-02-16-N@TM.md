## Blog / article on you and team
- **Reflection on glows/grows from your demo**
    - Glows
        - The pi chart with the food formatted with the data put and then showed both their chart and the study chart by the National association.
        - We were able to speak about all our functions properly.
        - Someone complimented the homepage and asked if they can take a photo of it.
    - Grows
        - The iframes were annoying to navigate around a little and should try to just have the actual functions stuff instead of linking to page.
        - All our teamates were not on the dot when N@TM started. I came in 1 minutes late and I only saw only 1 teamate at the table.
            - We had to present to someone with only 2 members and then are other teamates came midway when presenting to the person.
        - Sometimes some members were just standing there and not really doing anything while waiting for more people to come or listening into the presentation by their teamate to see if they can chime in so maybe we can find a way for everyone to be able to say something to the person to all feel included instead of just huddling around and saying nothing.
- **From feedback, something you will add to individual CPT project**
    - I will probably try to add fixes to the code such as stying on the front page or more patches in the authorization the user on the site. Currently the user works but without proper mapping like with the jwt token. If I can get this to work, there will be more meshed together functions.
- **Visuals or pics of team and people you talked**
    - We don't have any photos but from what I remeber, we talked to a lady, then a man, then a mother and daughter, and then a student.

## Log on event
- **Something you saw in CompSci that impressed**
    - I saw this CSA project that was about employment and finding people suitable for a criteria of languages of code. After making a user for myself, I then was put into the system and was able to be found with a specification search. With this, I was able to join a call with a link to a meetting room like zoom and was able to have a talk with an employer for example. I thought that the concept of connecting the employer and potential hire together with a simple zoom meeting with a unique id everytime was very cool.

- **Something you saw outside of CompSci that you liked**
    - I didn't walk around after my time schedule at N@TM. I stayed for around 25 minutes though just looking at computer science projects.
